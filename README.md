# medical_data_schema.sql
In this project, I focused on:

- Database creation
- Table schema design for hospitals, patients, physicians, operations, and medical plans
- Defining primary and foreign key constraints
- Inserting sample clinical data
- Modeling relationships that reflect healthcare workflows (patients, physicians, procedures, and hospitals)
